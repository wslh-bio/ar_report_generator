### main report text ###
sub.title: 'Antimicrobial Resistance Outbreak Report'
summary.paragraph: |
  This report describes the relatedness between a set of bacterial genomes from a suspected outbreak. [Summarize the results of your report here]
methods.text: |
  The figures shown here were generated using sequence data processed with the [sequence data analysis pipeline used here] data analysis pipeline. SNPs were called using the [SNP calling pipeline here] pipeline. If you have questions about this report please contact [contact information here].
disclaimer.text: |
  The information included in this report should only be used to support infection prevention measures. This report should not be used to guide treatment decisions, nor should it be included in the patient record.
  Whole-genome sequencing analysis is a rapidly evolving technology. Whole-genome sequencing and single nucleotide variant analysis will continue to be adjusted and refined over time due to the varied nature of bacterial genomes, limitations on available reference genomes and continual assessment of the inclusion of mobile genetic elements in this analysis. These results represent the most advanced method currently available for genome comparisons.

### optional report methodology and results text ###
heatmap.text: |
  The number of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) between each sample is shown on the heatmap below. There is no established rule for
  determining how many SNPs are needed to classify an outbreak. Generally it is best to look for patterns in the data between the SNP data and the
  phylogenetic tree. The samples are ordered based on the [distance method used here] between each sample.
tree.text: |
  Phylogenetic trees visualize the relatedness and genetic diversity of samples. Closely related samples will generally share a recent common ancestor and a small amount of horizontal distance on the tree.
ar_gene_summary.text: |
  This report shows a summary of all antimicrobial resistance genes detected using the [AR gene detection tool used here].
optionaldata.text: |
  [Information about any additional tables added to the report here]
